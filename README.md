# Amsterdam Trash
Simple interface to show information about trash collection in Amsterdam. In Dutch. Uses multiple APIs from [api.data.amsterdam.nl/api/](https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/api/): the typeahead API finds an address, the Address API converts that to coordinates, and the Trash API takes those coordinates and shows the relevant information about the trash collection (which days, times, etc).
